## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Delete API Endpoint:**
```
DELETE /api/brain/jobs/{job_id}/delete/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Quiz 'document.pdf' deleted successfully"
}
```

### **Frontend JavaScript:**
```javascript
function deleteQuiz(jobId, documentName) {
    if (confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete "${documentName}"?`)) {
        // Show loading state
        const deleteBtn = event.target.closest('button');
        deleteBtn.innerHTML = '<i class="ri-loader-4-line"></i>';
        deleteBtn.disabled = true;
        
        // Send delete request
        fetch(`/api/brain/jobs/${jobId}/delete/`, {
            method: 'DELETE',
            headers: {
                'X-CSRFToken': document.querySelector('[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]').value
            }
        })
        .then(response => {
            if (response.ok) {
                // Smooth removal animation
                const jobItem = deleteBtn.closest('.job-item');
                jobItem.style.opacity = '0';
                setTimeout(() => jobItem.remove(), 300);
                
                // Show success notification
                showNotification('Quiz deleted successfully', 'success');
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### **Backend View:**
```python
@login_required
@require_http_methods(["DELETE"])
def delete_job(request, job_id):
    job = get_object_or_404(ProcessingJob, id=job_id, user=request.user)
    
    # Delete associated files
    if job.document_file:
        job.document_file.delete(save=False)
    if job.extracted_text_file:
        job.extracted_text_file.delete(save=False)
    if job.output_file:
        job.output_file.delete(save=False)
    
    # Delete job (Q&A pairs deleted automatically via cascade)
    job.delete()
    
    return JsonResponse({'success': True})
```
