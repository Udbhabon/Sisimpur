Mitochondria are remarkable, dynamic organelles ubiquitous within nearly all eukaryotic cells, often described as the “powerhouses” of the cell because of their central role in producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation, yet this designation belies the myriad additional functions they perform; structurally, each mitochondrion is delineated by an outer membrane permeable to small molecules and an inner membrane folded into cristae that house the multisubunit complexes of the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient across the intermembrane space that drives ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP into ATP, while the inner matrix contains the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which oxidize acetyl‐CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to generate the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH₂ that feed into the respiratory chain. Beyond bioenergetics, mitochondria regulate cellular metabolism by tuning the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways through allosteric control of key enzymes by ATP, ADP, and calcium ions; indeed, they serve as critical buffers for cytosolic calcium, sequestering and releasing Ca²⁺ to shape cellular signaling cascades such as those controlling muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion. Mitochondria also harbor their own circular genome—mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)—which encodes 13 proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation along with 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs, reflecting their evolutionary origin from an ancestral α‐proteobacterium captured by a proto‐eukaryotic host in a symbiotic event over a billion years ago; the majority of mitochondrial proteins, however, are encoded in the nuclear genome, synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes, and imported via specialized translocases, a division of genetic labor that underscores the intricate crosstalk between nucleus and organelle. This crosstalk extends to quality control processes such as mitophagy, where dysfunctional mitochondria are selectively enveloped by autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation, thus maintaining cellular health and preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated as byproducts of electron leakage from the respiratory chain. Elevated mitochondrial ROS can initiate redox‐sensitive signaling pathways, but when uncontrolled contribute to oxidative damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, playing roles in pathologies as diverse as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s), cardiomyopathies, metabolic syndromes, and aging. Moreover, mitochondria govern programmed cell death through release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, a mechanism vital for development, immune responses, and elimination of damaged cells. Mitochondrial dynamics—continuous cycles of fission and fusion mediated by dynamin‐related GTPases such as Drp1, Mfn1/2, and OPA1—ensure proper distribution, morphology, and function, allowing cells to adapt mitochondrial morphology in response to metabolic demand or stress, segregate damaged segments for removal, and facilitate mitochondrial network connectivity for efficient energy distribution. In specialized cell types, mitochondria exhibit unique adaptations: brown adipocytes contain uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in their inner membrane to dissipate the proton gradient as heat for non‐shivering thermogenesis; spermatozoa concentrate mitochondria in the midpiece to power flagellar motility; and cardiomyocytes possess dense mitochondrial populations intercalated between myofibrils to meet relentless ATP demands. The diversity of mitochondrial proteomes across tissues reflects these specialized roles, while high‐resolution imaging techniques—including super‐resolution microscopy and cryo‐electron tomography—have unveiled mitochondrial ultrastructure in exquisite detail and illuminated contact sites between mitochondria and other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, where mitochondria‐associated membranes regulate lipid exchange and calcium signaling. Clinically, mitochondrial dysfunction underlies a spectrum of genetic disorders caused by mutations in mtDNA or nuclear‐encoded mitochondrial genes, presenting with multisystemic symptoms often affecting high‐energy–requiring tissues like brain, heart, and muscle; therapeutic approaches—from small molecules that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis or scavenge ROS to gene therapies aiming to correct mtDNA mutations and even mitochondrial replacement techniques—are under intense investigation. Recent research has further implicated mitochondria in innate immunity, as release of mitochondrial DNA and formyl peptides into the cytosol can activate inflammasomes and contribute to inflammatory responses, positioning mitochondria at the nexus of metabolism, cell death, and immune regulation. As our understanding deepens through advances in proteomics, metabolomics, and live‐cell imaging, mitochondria continue to reveal themselves not merely as static power generators but as dynamic hubs orchestrating cellular fate, health, and adaptation across the tree of life.
